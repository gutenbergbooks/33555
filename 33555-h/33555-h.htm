<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Beside the deep ravine the cottage stood,</SPAN><BR>
O'erlooking elm and willow, beech and birch,<BR>
In growth profuse and wild o'er shady stream:<BR>
And viewing cedar, oak and towering pine<BR>
On yonder crest aglow with light.  How grand<BR>
The vision in the greenness of the spring,<BR>
When birds of blue and scarlet vestments come;<BR>
The greater glory of the summer time,<BR>
When twinkling wings outvie the rarest flowers;<BR>
Or ripeness of the fall, when richest green<BR>
And gold and red in mass of tapestry<BR>
Delight the eye.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">But now the scene is white,</SPAN><BR>
Resplendent white.  No miser hand hath swept<BR>
The vale and heights but Nature bountiful<BR>
Of beauty dazzling pure, the season's own.<BR>
The spotless path below, meandering midst<BR>
O'erhanging boughs and drooping plants enwrapped<BR>
In feathered snow, a reverend scene, appears<BR>
As if for angels formed, who came to walk<BR>
This sacred aisle to worship winter's God.<BR>
The lofty pines that grace the other crest,<BR>
Enrobed in sparkling splendor, raise their heads<BR>
In solemn awe to yonder jewelled dome,<BR>
And offer praise to Him whose temple bright<BR>
Holds earth and sky.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Beneath a frosted birch,</SPAN><BR>
Lit up to brilliance by the burnished moon,<BR>
The shingle cottage stood, a humble home.<BR>
The labour of the day was done.  The lamp<BR>
Within sent out its yellow rays athwart<BR>
The silver snow and on the well-washed sheets<BR>
And other things that hung on lines and told<BR>
The woman's calling.  Work, from dawn of day<BR>
Till dark, with poor reward.<BR>

CHRISTMAS EVE<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">'Twas Christmas Eve.</SPAN><BR>
The mother and her little boy (his name<BR>
Was David Annandale) sat down to read<BR>
And converse hold before they sought repose.<BR>
A widow young, with richest auburn hair,<BR>
Bright hazel eyes 'neath finely arching brows,<BR>
Teeth of pearl, and sympathetic smile<BR>
Most sweet.  No wonder that her child, a lad<BR>
Of six, with raven hair and ruddy cheeks,<BR>
Should find in her alone his heart's desire,<BR>
His reigning thought, the perfect one.  His eyes<BR>
Lovelit no blemish saw in careworn looks.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Her stories, read and told with girlish zeal,<BR>
Of beaver, bear and wolf, and jet black squirrel,<BR>
But, best of all, of smiling Santa Claus,<BR>
Aroused an interest intense.  The deep<BR>
Ravine itself and other themes all passed<BR>
Beneath her spell.  And he, tho' entertained,<BR>
Was also purified and lifted up.<BR>
"My mother, dear," he said, "When I'm a man,<BR>
I'll work and work for you, and buy a castle<BR>
And a carriage; you will be a lady,<BR>
And nevermore be tired."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Tired himself at last,</SPAN><BR>
His eyelids fell.  He dreamed a moment deep,<BR>
Then wide awoke and starting up he wept,<BR>
And as he sobbed he said, "I've seen my kitten<BR>
In the cold ravine.  Oh, let it in!"<BR>
This was a kitten lost a while before,<BR>
A creature in his heart as much as treasure<BR>
Real or ideal fills the heart<BR>
Of any ardent man.  He ever longed<BR>
And hoped for its return.  And every night<BR>
The door was opened and the yearning call<BR>
Went out into the empty air.  And every<BR>
Night he saw the lost one's dish supplied,<BR>
Which morning found untouched.  The mother did<BR>
Her best to stay his tears, and as she bent<BR>
And tucked him warm in bed she said that maybe<BR>
Santa Claus would bring another kitten.<BR>
"Tie a great big stocking, mother; make it<BR>
Open wide and warm."  She did so, kissed him,<BR>
And he closed his eyes.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">One hand alone,</SPAN><BR>
Would fill that empty stocking, nor forget<BR>
A friend or neighbor would come later on,<BR>
But David's eyes when morning came would look<BR>
On emptiness, save for mother's hand.  Nay, stay,&mdash;<BR>
At midnight, yea, at midnight, when the moon<BR>
Was still a silver lamp, a creature poor,<BR>
Benighted, wandered to the cottage door.<BR>
Ill-treated, cold, too sick to cry, it looked<BR>
With wistful eyes beneath the fastened door.<BR>
Then turned and went aside and trembling climbed<BR>
The sloping birchen tree and reached the roof.<BR>
Adown the chimney peered, then slowly crept,<BR>
Then fell.  It lay upon the hearth a time.<BR>
But lured, it lapped the milk, and, strengthened, strove<BR>
To climb into the little sleeper's cot.<BR>
It strove but failed, and, guided by a gentle<BR>
Hand, it fell at last into the open<BR>
Stocking, head above, and finding comfort,<BR>
Softly purred and slept.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Ah, sleeping boy,</SPAN><BR>
Thou dreamest not the joy awaiting thee&mdash;<BR>
The empty place within thy heart shall soon<BR>
Be filled, thy grief assuaged, thy hot tears dried.<BR>
'Tis little value&mdash;but 'tis much to thee&mdash;<BR>
Because thy love is wrapped up there, and love<BR>
Is value's measure in the heart of rich<BR>
And poor.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">The boy awoke and rubbed his eyes.</SPAN><BR>
The sun had risen o'er the grand ravine,<BR>
A silver scene, and sent its slanting rays<BR>
Of gold beneath the blind, across the cot.<BR>
He waited not, but crept along and looked<BR>
Below.  Two eyes looked up.  A moment mutual<BR>
Magnetized, transfixed!  He drew the creature<BR>
From its woollen bed, he kissed it,&mdash;pressed it<BR>
To his cheek&mdash;and wept for joy.  The mother<BR>
Woke.  The midnight "gift" was seen and gladly<BR>
Welcomed home while David slept, and now<BR>
She also wept for joy.  No home was happier<BR>
On that Christmas morn.  No gift was costlier<BR>
Than the gift that meant the wasted worthless<BR>
Waif's return.<BR>

THE LURKING FOE<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Till early spring (too soon),</SPAN><BR>
While David went to school, and learned well,<BR>
The widow bravely labored on 'mid frost<BR>
And snow and storm, thro' strain of overwork<BR>
And worse.  Inhaled, mayhap, from matter bad,<BR>
Close-handled in her calling (who can trace<BR>
The lurking venom foe?) the wasting plague<BR>
Had found a cruel lodgment in her breast.<BR>
"One hope remains," the kind physician said&mdash;<BR>
Who made no charge for visits not a few&mdash;<BR>
"'Tis institutional treatment where the air<BR>
Is light and pure, where food is plentiful,<BR>
And rest abounds."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">The parting wrench was sore.</SPAN><BR>
The mother hid her grief and tears, and smiled,<BR>
But David wept without restraint.  A farming<BR>
Couple sympathetic offered refuge<BR>
For awhile, and when he went away<BR>
(His kitten in a basket 'neath his arm),<BR>
His heart was heavy&mdash;for the sun was down,<BR>
The world was dark.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">But five months' treatment free</SPAN><BR>
Was great and good, and David's mother seemed<BR>
To be restored to health, for strength was there<BR>
And color beautiful.  'Twas not enough,<BR>
Tho' all that could be given, that other waiting<BR>
Sufferers might have a chance to live.<BR>
With rest at home the healing work begun<BR>
Would one day be complete.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Ye men of wealth,</SPAN><BR>
And all that generous give, with all that halt,<BR>
Herein your golden opportunity<BR>
Doth lie.  A home you have prepared for them<BR>
That leave the prison cell, and this is well.<BR>
But what awaits the convalescent widow<BR>
And the orphan, fighting off the wasting plague?<BR>
Suspicion&mdash;dread&mdash;a refuge craved for vainly<BR>
Here and there&mdash;a battle hopeless, lost.<BR>
Awake, awake!  Oh, give the shelter sure<BR>
A child would give to any famished waif!<BR>
Oh, wake, compassion, wake!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">When David, big</SPAN><BR>
With joy, returned, the wind sang in the trees,<BR>
The flowers, red and white, a welcome smiled,<BR>
The cottage seemed to be a prince's home,<BR>
And mother in her loveliness a queen,<BR>
While in the mother's eyes her child appeared<BR>
As if a shepherd lad, he looked so strong,<BR>
So lithe, and ruddy.  But the only flock<BR>
That David had consisted of a kitten,<BR>
Now a cat renowned of tiger-stripe<BR>
And fat.  And once again the cottage-home<BR>
Gave foretaste of the other, deathless, pure,<BR>
And glad, for love was there.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">With quenchless hope</SPAN><BR>
The happy widow bravely bent her shoulders<BR>
To the yoke again.  She had her boy<BR>
To live for, work for, love, and he would be<BR>
A man some day, and strong, when she would lean<BR>
On him as he had leaned on her.  And yet<BR>
The yoke was heavy, and grew heavier<BR>
As vigour waned.  In spite of hope and will<BR>
She craved for rest.  Or even if the wage<BR>
Were better, labour could be lessened<BR>
And give more of rest.<BR>
</P>

ON STRIKE<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">One day some workmen</SPAN><BR>
Struck for better pay.  And David wondered<BR>
What it meant to strike.  "What is it, mother?&mdash;<BR>
Do they hit the men that give them work?"<BR>
The mother smiled.  "No, no, my child, they merely<BR>
Rest or cease from work to force their masters<BR>
Into giving better pay to get them<BR>
Back to work."  A happy thought now seized him&mdash;<BR>
"Oh, mother, strike, and then the people sure<BR>
Will give you better pay."  The mother smiled,<BR>
But sighed and said, "My darling boy, if I<BR>
Should strike, a score of women poor are ready,<BR>
Even glad, to take my place, perchance for less."<BR>
The boy was disappointed, and his heart<BR>
Was sad.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">But "strike," that odd word strike, as meaning</SPAN><BR>
Rest from work, or stopping work, clung fast<BR>
To David's mind.  Apart from better pay<BR>
He thought that something good remained, and so<BR>
At night, the last thing done before he slept,<BR>
The boy would often take his board, a blackboard<BR>
Big, and chalk in letters large and white&mdash;<BR>
"On strike till 7," "On strike till 6," "On strike<BR>
Till 5," according as his mother's work<BR>
Required, or strength could stand.  The metal clock,<BR>
A loud alarum, was also wound and set.<BR>
At this the mother always smiled, but when<BR>
Her treasure's eyes were closed in sleep she wept.<BR>
She dared not bend and kiss those cherub lips.<BR>
His lovely face grew paler day by day,<BR>
And dread, an awful dread, laid hold of her.<BR>
And she herself was wasting swift and sure&mdash;<BR>
The candle flame was burning low.<BR>
</P>

ANOTHER CHRISTMAS<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Two nights, not more, before the Christmas eve,</SPAN><BR>
A heap of things for washing lay against<BR>
The wall.  Alas, at any time too great,<BR>
The present task might break the weary back,<BR>
But Christmas need was pressing and the labour<BR>
Must be done.  (Oh, spare that wasted frame!<BR>
Hear, O Lord, the widow's cry!)<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">The weary, yet the watchful boy,</SPAN><BR>
His blackboard took and wrote in letters big<BR>
And urgent, seeming charged with meaning strange.<BR>
And the clock's alarum was set.  And now<BR>
On bended knee beside his mother's knee<BR>
He spoke his simple prayer, pleading lastly<BR>
That his mother might have better wages<BR>
And have rest.  And, oh, the mother's heart<BR>
Went with him, with himself before the throne,<BR>
Forgetful, ay entirely, of herself.<BR>
A wild temptation seized her.  She would clasp,<BR>
Yea, fiercely hug, that wasted angel-body<BR>
To her breast, and kiss those guileless, beauteous,<BR>
Sweetest lips.  Alas! she knew the worst<BR>
Had come&mdash;those eyes, uplifted, hollow, shining,<BR>
Spoke of death.  And why refrain?  She would not,<BR>
Yea, she drank the cup of pleasure to the full.<BR>
The child was glad, and went to rest,<BR>
A smile of heaven on his lips.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">And now the mother satisfied, as one</SPAN><BR>
With strongest wine, rose up, and ope'd the door.<BR>
She looked abroad a moment, then went out<BR>
Into the silent air.  The deep ravine<BR>
Was glorious white.  The mighty pines were robed<BR>
As if prepared to sing in heaven's choir<BR>
On earth, when strong the northern tempest blew.<BR>
The widow, vigour getting for a little<BR>
From the frosty air, admired the scene,<BR>
And lifting up her eyes to sparkling worlds<BR>
Above, she felt assured, though human help<BR>
And pity wholly failed, that somewhere, sometime,<BR>
There was plenteous rest.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">And yet she thanked</SPAN><BR>
And praised the Power that good and evil gave,<BR>
For one brief cup of pleasure, if no more&mdash;<BR>
Her pleasure in her darling boy.  "Take him,<BR>
O Lord, whatever portion mine."<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">The tension loosed,</SPAN><BR>
The stricken widow turned, yet ere she turned<BR>
She scanned the northern shore of brilliant night,<BR>
And, lo, a mountain mass of tempest clouds<BR>
Lined up for battle with the sleeping south.<BR>
The woman, fearless, smiled as if in kinship<BR>
With the coming storm.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">But having struggled, spoken,</SPAN><BR>
Pleaded strong, her transient vigour gone,<BR>
She stumbled to the door and entered in.<BR>
Beside the bed, she saw the letters written<BR>
On the board, as if the sacred writing<BR>
On the wall.  She saw the slender lovely hand<BR>
Exposed that wrote them, and she bowed and kissed it,<BR>
But she could not weep.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">Ere midnight came,</SPAN><BR>
The child awoke, disturbed, and anxious said,<BR>
"Oh, mother dear, what is that awful sound?"<BR>
"My darling, 'tis the sighing of the wind<BR>
Among the pines."  But swifter sped the tempest,<BR>
Swifter, and the pines&mdash;they bowed their heads<BR>
Before the blast and sang.  The cedars high<BR>
And oaks together answered back in song,<BR>
And louder, louder, as if thunder grand,<BR>
The tempest bell of music rang.  The boy<BR>
Awoke again, and feebly cried&mdash;"Oh, mother,<BR>
I'm afraid&mdash;what is that dreadful sound?"<BR>
"My darling, fear not, 'tis the voice of God&mdash;<BR>
He leads the choir.  And he remembers you<BR>
And me."  "Oh, mother, take me in beside you,<BR>
I'm afraid of God, but Jesus"&mdash;Here he stopped.<BR>
He struggled till he got in part athwart<BR>
The cot.  And as his wearied head sank down<BR>
He whispered faintly, and there came a broken<BR>
Answer, whispering&mdash;"Near me, nearer, darling"&mdash;<BR>
That was all.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 3em">The storm, the mother's music.</SPAN><BR>
But the child's affright, attained its height.<BR>
Then sudden rang the loud alarum.  But<BR>
They heard it not.<BR>
</P>

<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 10%; letter-spacing: 2em">*****</SPAN><BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
There was once a manger,<BR>
Once a cross, and both by man despised.<BR>
But God hath both exalted high.  And once<BR>

Tho' He seemed to be in wrath.<BR>

Did not come, nor one.  A child, a girl<BR>
With golden hair and gray-blue laughing eyes,<BR>

Walked through the spotless wreaths of snow.  The morning<BR>

And duly signed by David Annandale.<BR>
She saw the mother's snow-white face upturned<BR>
To heaven.  She saw the raven locks of David<BR>
Strewn upon her breast.  And saw his face&mdash;<BR>
'Twas also white as snow.  The tragic scene<BR>
Was quickly seen.  She stood amazed a moment,<BR>
Then approached, uncertain, all atremble.<BR>
And she softly pressed her playmate's brow.<BR>
The chill of death went thro' her, and she gave<BR>
A piercing cry and fled.<BR>
